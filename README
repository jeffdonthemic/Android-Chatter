Salesforce Chatter for Android

This is the demo of the application that I submitted for the Chatter Developer Challenge (2010). It is a Salesforce Chatter for Android app running on a combination of the Force.com platform, Google App Engine and a Google Android mobile handset. It utilizes Force.com Remote Access Applications with 3-legged OAuth for security. The Android application has the following functionality:

Display your Chatter NewsFeed
Update your User status
Refresh your Chatter NewsFeed and store it in the local SQLite database
Choose a project (custom object) that you are following and view its Chatter Feed
Update the projectâ€™s status
Refresh the Chatter Feed for the project (including field changes to the record) and store it in the local SQLite database
